## About Me
_Hey there, I'm Nicholas Nguyen, currently 2nd year Computer Science major at UCSD. My coding journey began in sophomore year of high school, where I was introduced to the fundamentals of programming and also where I first learned the iconic "hello world":_
```
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
hello()
```
_Fueled by my interest in algorithms and software development, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges to grow my expertise. I'm eager to continue my exploration of technology, driven by my passion for innovation and problem-solving. Outside of academics, you'll often find me hitting the gym, enjoying meals with friends, and occasionally unwinding at raves for some fun-filled moments with my buddies._
